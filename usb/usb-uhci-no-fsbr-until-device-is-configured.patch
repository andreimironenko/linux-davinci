Subject: USB: UHCI: No FSBR until device is configured
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44L0.0601231708160.7889-100000@iolanthe.rowland.org>


Some USB devices don't enumerate well with FSBR turned on.  This patch 
keeps devices on the low-speed part of the schedule (which doesn't use 
FSBR) until they have been fully configured.
