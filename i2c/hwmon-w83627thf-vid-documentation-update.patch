-Technically, the w83627thf does not support a VID reading. However, it's
-possible or even likely that your mainboard maker has routed these signals
-to a specific set of general purpose IO pins (the Asus P4C800-E is one such
-board). The w83627thf driver now interprets these as VID. If the VID on

+The w83627_HF_ uses pins 110-106 as VID0-VID4. The w83627_THF_ uses the
+same pins as GPIO[0:4]. Technically, the w83627_THF_ does not support a
+VID reading. However the two chips have the identical 128 pin package. So,
+it is possible or even likely for a w83627thf to have the VID signals routed
+to these pins despite their not being labeled for that purpose. Therefore,
+the w83627thf driver interprets these as VID. If the VID on your board
+doesn't work, first see doc/vid in the lm_sensors package[1]. If that still
+doesn't help, you may just ignore the bogus VID reading with no harm done.
